# Information

The presented website is something in the shape of a personal portfolio. It aims to present my programming qualifications. This is done by presenting examples of created tools/applications.

## Briefly about me

Java programmer (Junior level) plus frontend, without formal commercial experience in programming. I have several projects of utility tools (also implemented on servers) that, for example, support my and others' work in the production plant. "Technical and IT" studies (master), Postgraduate studies in Programming in **Java** [`more`](#more-about-me)

## Technologies

- Java;
- Python (basic);
- JavaScript;
- HTML, CSS;
- MySQL;
- Frameworks, interfaces and standards:
	- JakartaEE;
	- Spring Framework;
	- JDBC, JPA, Hibernate, CRUD;
	- AngularJS;
	- MySQL;
	- Jenkins

## Skills

* Intermediate level of Java language;;
* Ability to work with JavaScript, HTML and CSS;
* Basic level of Python;
* Knowledge of databases and SQL;
* Basic knowledge of version control and continuous integration and delivery tools (CI/CD) (GIT, Jenkins, Docker)

## Practical skills

* Working in the appropriate development environment (such as IntelliJ, Spring Tool Suite or Android Studio), choosing the right dependencies and the ability to create a project in **Java** (traditional or web applications, also for Android systems);

* Creating a database that will cooperate with the project: establishing a connection with the database, using object-relational mapping technology in communication between the application logic and the database;

* Creating an application view layer, using JPA technology (JakartaServerPages) or templates (like Thymeleaf). Also working with a more advanced solution using the AngularJS framework (it can be a separate application);

* Ability to write tests for the created application and ensure proper validation of data processed by the application (JUnit, Mockito);

* Ability to implement the authorization process in the created application (also using a database);

* Installation of the necessary software on the server and deployment of the application to the server under the Debian system (including domain assignment);

* Using version control tools such as GIT (GitHub) for collaboration with others and for continuous software delivery (Jenkins);

* Ability to create a web project in Python, e.g. in the PyCharm environment;

![TroublesAppImage](troubles_app.jpg)

#### Technologies

* Application written in **Java** using the **Spring** framework;
* Uses **MySQL** relational database;
* View layer developed with **AngularJS**

#### Funkcionalities

* The ability to easily browse and search for available quality problems in the database and view the typical causes of a given problem and its proposed solutions;
* Registration and login service implemented;
* The ability to enter your own causes and solutions to a given problem to the logged-in user;

## Utility Recorder

A desktop tool helpful in monitoring the consumption of utilities, such as water or electricity (it can also be used to record other things). It saves the data to a file, reads it into a table and calculates consumption between records, totals and averages. The data is presented in a simple graph.

![UtilityRecorderToolImage](utility_recorder.jpg)

#### Technologies

* Application written in **Java**;
* Standard libraries for window applications like **Swing** were used

#### Functionalities

* Creating a new record, adding table entries, editing data;
* Calculation of consumption, average and preview of data on the diagram;
* Permanent recording of data in a file;
* Ability to edit data from the file level

#### Linki

## Energy balance monitoring application

My final project in Java Application Development. The app is a food/activity diary and provides personal energy balance calculations. The view layer uses templates.

![MyBalanceAppImage](my_balance_app.jpg)

#### Technologies

* Application written in Java using the Spring framework;
* Uses MySQL relational database;
* In the view layer was used The Thymeleaf template

#### Functionalities

* Login and registration carried out using a database;
* Possibility of keeping a food/activity diary - adding and deleting entries;
* Database of meals and activities from which you can add items to your diary;
* Ability to expand the base with new meals and activities;
* Calculation of the balance for any range and its evaluation based on the user's needs;
* Calculation and evaluation of BMI (Body Mass Index);
* Ability to view and edit user data

## Production Execution Calculator

A simple tool that calculates the estimated production lead time and other values based on inputs such as machine cycle time, production volume and product weight. Useful for daily production supervision in a packaging production plant in the "injection-blowing" process.

![CalcAppImage](calc.jpg)

#### Technologies

* HTML, CSS, JvaScript;
* Calculations in JavaScript;

#### Functionalities

* The ability to quickly calculate the production and obtain a real time of execution on the website without the need to perform complex calculations (such as "manually" converting seconds to hours and minutes and adding to the current time);
* Obtaining additional information, such as: efficiency and weight of the raw material needed for a given production.

## Production Execution Calculator - Android

Android version of the tool that calculates the estimated production lead time and other values based on inputs such as machine cycle time, production volume and product weight. The tool is useful for daily production supervision in a packaging production plant in the "injection-blowing" process.

![AndroidCalcAppImage](calc_for_android.jpg)

#### Technologies

* Java with specialized classes for Android;
* User interface in XML tags;

#### Functionalities

* Possibility to quickly calculate the production execution and obtain a specific execution time in the downloaded and installed offline tool without the need to perform complex calculations (such as "manually" converting seconds to hours and minutes and adding to the current hour);
* Obtaining additional information, such as: efficiency and weight of the raw material needed for a given production.

# More about me

* Born in 1984, residing in Zielona Góra city;

* In the years 2003 -2008 I studied: 'Technical and Information Technology Education' at the University of Zielona Góra, where, among other things, I acquired basic knowledge of computer science and programming (general computer science, HTML and programming languages - mainly Turbo Pascal) and gained pedagogical preparation for teaching technology and computer science ( IT teaching practices);

* Years 2020/2021 Postgraduate studies: Programming Java applications, WSB University in Wrocław;

* I have many years of experience in production work as production supervision, process setting and machine repair;

* Experience as a CNC operator (as well as the course "Operation and programming of numerically controlled machine tools");

* Although I did not work 'commercially' in the IT sector, I have some IT knowledge (including programming) gained years ago. And for years I have been interested in controlling the production process in industry (interest in automation, CNC machines, attempts to start a business based on manufacturing a product on CNC in the past);

* Recently, I decided on my own initiative (beyond my professional duties) to create the production tools described above, which help some employees to supervise production in the plant where I was employed until recently (September 2022).
